# chessUI ♟️
Java chess program. In preparation for my Java module at the University of Sheffield, I took the time to learn Java through making a chess project. The project was never completed but nevertheless I have chosen to make it public. 

I hope to include a basic AI for the player to play against. As of present time, most rules are implemented including en passant, checks, checkmate and stalemate. 50 move and 75 move rules and proper promotions are yet to be implemented.
